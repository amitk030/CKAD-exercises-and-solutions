### There exist a namespace `blue-green`, a deployment named `blue`. Also a service named `nginx-svc` exposing the `nginx` deployment on port `80`. If you request the service it will return `This is blue deployment`. Create another deployment named `green` with label `mark=green` & `image=nginx:1.19.8` and make changes such that it should return `This is green deployment` while calling `nginx-svc` service. Delete `blue` deployment.

#### make request to the service now it should return `This is green deployment`(by running `wget -O- <nginx-svc-ip-address>`).
